# UI interactions test
 

## Purpose of the test

This test is designed to be a chance for us to see how you approach your development work and if you have a creative spark.  

It is not essential that you finish the test, more that you structure your code and develop as you would day to day. The test should take between 2-3 hours (give or take), and you are free to use any resource at your disposal.  

## Submission of your test

Please commit the full source code as you go, your final commit should leave the code base able to be run and not error, even if it is not completely finished. 

## Challenge

This test is focused mainly on visuals.

The code contains a simple react app (stood up with create-react-app). Styled-components has been installed and is in use.

The react app has a single Card component which has minimal styling and currently displays 2 of the pieces of information available to the Card via its props.

We'd like you to (in any order):

1. Finish off implementing, positioning and styling the rest of the props in the Card and display them the best way you see fit.
2. Polish the card as you see fit, by adding any micro interactions, animations, transitions or visual elements you deem neccassary like icons, fonts etc.
3. Create an 'Editing' state for the Cards props which allows the user to edit some, or all of them e.g. title, firstName, email etc. and save them to the current components state.

For this test you dont have to worry about responsivness.
